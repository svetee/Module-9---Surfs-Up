# Module-9---Surfs-Up

## Purpose

To help W.Avy to simply understand the provided data and giving him elements to make the right decision on opening a surf shop in Oahu.

## Analysis and Challenges
Many database functions did not work well when running my code until I have updated my material version and importing dependencies.

## Results
- The minimum temperature for the month of June is 64f, and 56F for the month of December. 
- The average temperature for the month of June is 75f, and 71F for the month of December.
- The maximum temperature for the month of June is 85f, and 83F for the month of December.

## Summary
- Gather data on airlines fill rate. 
- Gather data on hotels fill rate. 
- Run the same code for the years preceding 2017 for the same months of June and December, then plot the results into a line chart to see the evolution and the change of temperature.
- Analyze precipitation rates to see if there is a risk for flooding.
- Look at hurricane weather forcasting data- for example high precipitation data and high wind speeds.
